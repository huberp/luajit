This version was compiled from the v2.1 branch on November 8, 2014.

Added flags: -msse -msse2 -static-libgcc

For the Windows platform, LUA_PATH and LUA_CPATH were changed from the default
in luaconf.h as follows:

	`..\..\?.lua;..\..\?\init.lua` was added to LUA_PATH.
	This makes `require()` work independent of the current directory.

	LUA_CPATH was changed from '!\?.dll' to `!\clib\?.dll`.
	This is done to separate Lua/C modules from other binary dependencies,
	which prevents name clashes and allows the luapower script
	to distinguish Lua/C modules from other library files.

__NOTE__: These changes to LUA_PATH allow an app to be run from any
directory, providing that the luapower directory structure is used, i.e.
place Lua modules 2 directories up from the LuaJIT binary.
